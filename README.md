# Malaria-Detection

All the software requirements are mentioned in the requirements.txt file 
The model i have chosen is VGG19, feel free to try out other models too and tune the parameters.
The number of Epochs is kept 3, if you are training on your GPU change it to 10 for better results.
Also the link to kaggle dataset is given below you can train the model on that datset if you have access to GPU (or u can use Colab or kaggle gpu/tpu)
